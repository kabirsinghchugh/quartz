Consists of three measures A U and M

## A

- Observe that bottom of throat and mouth is open
- The sound within expressed outward - manifestation

## U

- A is transformed in the mouth by a narrowed channeling through pursing the lips
- Represents the subtle - the mind works with impressions of sense objects

## M

- Resonant
- Closed lips and mouth - Humming - Drone sound(background)
- Mother,ma
- Unlike the generative A tapers to nothing
