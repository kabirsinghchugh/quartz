### How Changes in Transport Costs Can Change the Spatial Makeup of Economies

- Consider a world with  positive transport costs between regions, and constant returns to scale  technology: there is no reason for trade, since transport is costly, and  everything can be produced at the same cost in each region.
- To generate cities and trade, then, we  need some sort of increasing returns to scale in production, whether  than be directly in the factor, through some aggregation of knowledge, or  whatever.

imagine a poor and a rich country decrease the  transport costs between the two (i.e., the EU builds a railroad from  Germany to Poland). In a spatial model, this will generally lead to more  aggregation of high-value production in the wealthier country, due to  greater efficiency in the high-value sector resulting from increasing  returns to scale.

Clearly, production is not the only reason cities exist – Glaeser,  among others, has pointed out that consumption externalities, like access  to opera, exist as well – but nonetheless understanding the economics of  cities in a world of declining transport and communication prices is  critical for current urban policy.
