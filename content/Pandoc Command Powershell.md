Can you breakdown the following command and explain it to me as if I am a novice

`gci -r -i *.txt |foreach{$rtf=$_.directoryname+"\"+$_.basename+".rtf";pandoc -f markdown -s $_.name -o $rtf}`

This command is written for PowerShell, a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It performs a series of actions to find text files (.txt), then converts them into RTF (Rich Text Format) files using Pandoc, a universal document converter. Let's break down this command piece by piece:

1. **`gci -r -i *.txt`**:
   - `gci` is an alias for the `Get-ChildItem` command, which lists items in one or more specified locations (like the `ls` or `dir` command in other shells).
   - `-r` is a flag that stands for "recursive," meaning it will search not just in the current directory, but also in all its subdirectories.
   - `-i` is short for `-Include`, specifying a filter to only include files that match a certain pattern.
   - `*.txt` is the pattern, indicating you're interested in all files that have a `.txt` extension.

2. **`|`**:
   - This is the pipeline operator. It takes the output of the command on its left (in this case, the list of `.txt` files found by `Get-ChildItem`) and passes it as input to the command on its right.

3. **`foreach{$rtf=$_.directoryname+"\"+$_.basename+".rtf"; pandoc -f markdown -s $_.name -o $rtf}`**:
   - `foreach` is a loop that iterates over each item that comes through the pipeline. Inside the braces `{}` is the code to be executed for each item.
   - `$_` represents the current item in the loop, which would be a `.txt` file found by the first part of the command.
   - `$_.directoryname` extracts the directory name (path) of the current file.
   - `$_.basename` gets the file name without the extension.
   - `+".rtf"` adds the `.rtf` extension to the base name.
   - `$rtf=$_.directoryname+"\"+$_.basename+".rtf"` constructs the full path for the new `.rtf` file by combining the directory name, a backslash (as a directory separator), the base name of the `.txt` file, and the `.rtf` extension, then assigns this path to the variable `$rtf`.
   - `pandoc -f markdown -s $_.name -o $rtf`: This part of the command calls Pandoc to convert the `.txt` file to an `.rtf` file.
     - `-f markdown` specifies the input format, which is Markdown. It assumes that your `.txt` files are in Markdown format.
     - `-s` includes a standalone document as the output.
     - `$_.name` is the name of the current `.txt` file, including its extension.
     - `-o $rtf` specifies the output file, which is the `.rtf` file path constructed earlier.

Putting it all together:

- The command searches recursively in the current directory and all subdirectories for `.txt` files.
- For each `.txt` file found, it constructs a new file path with the same base name but with an `.rtf` extension, placed in the same directory as the original `.txt` file.
- It then calls Pandoc to convert each `.txt` file from Markdown format to an RTF file, saving the converted files with the constructed `.rtf` file paths.

If it were to be converted as a command in zsh in unix, what would the equivalent command be?

To achieve the same functionality in `zsh` on a Unix-like system, you can use the `find` command combined with a loop to process each `.txt` file found. This approach leverages the Unix philosophy of chaining simple, robust tools like `find` and `xargs`, along with shell scripting capabilities. Here's how you could translate the command:

```zsh
find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec sh -c '
for file do
  rtf="${file%.*}.rtf"
  pandoc -f markdown -s "$file" -o "$rtf"
done
' sh {} +
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. **`find . -type f -name "*.txt"`**:
   - `find` is a command used to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
   - `.` specifies the current directory as the starting point for the search.
   - `-type f` restricts the search to files only (excluding directories, symbolic links, etc.).
   - `-name "*.txt"` searches for files that end with `.txt`.

2. **`-exec sh -c '…' sh {} +`**:
   - `-exec` allows you to execute a command on the files found by `find`.
   - `sh -c '…'` invokes a new shell to run the commands enclosed in quotes.
   - The loop `for file do … done` iterates over each file passed to the shell. The `{}` is replaced by the path of each file found by `find`, and `+` at the end causes `find` to pass all found files at once to the shell command, allowing the loop to process them.
   - Within the loop, the variable `file` represents each `.txt` file found.
   - `rtf="${file%.*}.rtf"` constructs the new filename by removing the `.txt` extension (using `${file%.*}`) and appending `.rtf`.
   - `pandoc -f markdown -s "$file" -o "$rtf"` converts the `.txt` file to an `.rtf` file, as described earlier.

This command does essentially the same thing as the PowerShell command: it finds all `.txt` files, and for each one, it constructs a corresponding `.rtf` filename and uses Pandoc to convert the file from Markdown to RTF, preserving the directory structure.
